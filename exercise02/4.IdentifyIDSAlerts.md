See [PortScanReport.txt](./PortScanReport.txt) for info of all reports caused by the NMAP port scan. The commandline used for this particular port scan was `nmap -t4 -a -v 192.168.56.102`. 

The following are most of the Events created by the port scan:
```

This is just a simple tcp calls to different ports trying to discover what kind
of services are running on these ports NMAP simply is just sending SYN calls to
those endpoints to see if it can get a response and identify what services are
running on it. This especially helps in building an attack because NMAP tries
to find out what versions are running on these ports. One way to protect
against this is to have the firewall block any access from the internet unless
it is a whitelisted IP.  Furthermore here we can guess how the intrusion
detection system managed to find out about this port scan or was able to mark
it as suspicious. Because this is a port connected to a database and in normal
traffic a request to such a service is deliberate so it is suspicious to only
receive a SYN call but never any more more responses, especially if it happened
so closely with other similar calls to other ports. If the IDS rules on
security onion are able to perceive context especially for such a standard
attack then seeing multiple different port scans is definitely suspicious,
still such a call on its own can already be suspicious enough to warrant an
alert.

Since ssh is typically running on port 22 it is also often a typical attack to
get on remote machines, if they are not secured with a strong password they
often can be a way to get access to a remote machine. So a insecure connection
attempt is always suspicious and should always be reported.

In this prope NMAP is trying to find out which operating system is running on
the machine. This is a very valuable piece of info which can allow attackers to find weaknesses in the system.
Especially if the attacker finds an outdated version of the kernel which is missing an important security patch.
The reason for the relatively high count of these kind of messages is because NMAP is sending a selection of propes to determine the OS via the responses it receives:[^1]
> Nmap includes a huge database of heuristics for identifying thousands of different systems based on how they respond to a selection of TCP/IP probes. Another system (part of version detection) interrogates open TCP or UDP ports to determine device type and OS details. Results of these two systems are reported independently so that you can identify combinations such as a Checkpoint firewall forwarding port 80 to a Windows IIS server.

of course again something like this is probably well known and easy to spot with a rule especially since nmap is open source so you know how such an attack will look like and of course someone trying to sniff out weaknesses in your system should be reported.
